    Welcome to another adventure from the world of Kroz.  First discovered in  
 Kingdom of Kroz published on Big Blue Disk #20, the series was continued eight 
 issues later (BBD #28) with Dungeons of Kroz.  Well, Scott Miller has returned 
 with a new set of adventures called the ^1Caverns of Kroz^0.                  
                                                                               
    The Caverns of Kroz is a game of exploration and survival.  Your journey   
 will take you through 40 very perilous levels, each riddled with diabolical   
 traps and hideous creatures.  Hidden in the deepest cavern lies the priceless  
 Amulet--your quest.                                                          
                                                                              
    The dungeons contain dozens of treasures, spells, traps, and other        
 mysteries.  Touching an object for the first time will reveal a little of its  
 identity, but it will be left up to you decide how best to use it or avoid it.
 When a creature touches you it will vanish, taking a few of your gems that you 
 have collected.  If you have no gems, the creature will instead take your     
 life!  Whips can be used to kill nearby creatures, but they are better used to 
 smash through crumbled walls and forest terrain.                            
                                                                              
    You can save a game in progress in order to resume after an interruption or 
 have several tries at a tough level without retracing all previous levels.   
 However, only the status as of the beginning of the current level is saved;  
 anything you did after you entered the level won't be saved.  You've got to  
 make it to the end of the level and save again for your later gains to be    
 preserved.
