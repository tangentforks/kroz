MISC NOTES ABOUT THIS RELEASE
====================================================================

- Originally, when Kroz was a "new" title in the late 80's, the source code to the games used to be sold.  Here's a listing of what the source code would have cost 20 years ago had you been interested in buying it.  This was for more than just Kroz, as well.

* Kingdom of Kroz (Turbo Pascal 3.0) - $190
* Supernova (Turbo Pascal 3.0)       -  125
* Word Whiz (Turbo Pascal 5.0)       -  100
* Trek Trivia (Turbo Pascal 5.0)     -   90
* Return to Kroz (Turbo Pascal 5.0)  -  350
* Asteroid Rescue (Turbo Pascal 3.0) -   45
* Lost Adventures of Kroz (TP 5.0)   -  950
* Rogue Runner (TP 3.0)              -   45

- As was said above, not all the source code for all the Kroz games is here.  We looked around, and could not find any more than what is included in this archive.  There's also duplicates (and in some cases triplicate) backups of the same game.  It was decided to just go ahead and include everything we have as opposed to trying to clean up the multiple backups.   That's why you see backup1 and backup2 as some directory names.
