
SLOW.COM
	uses the timer click interupt to slow down the AT, it sets up a
user routine to be called on each click (interupt 1Ch), the user routine
just does a delay loop, interupts are enabled during the loop so interupt
driven devices like the keyboard still work, but the machine seems to be
slowed down (even though it's running at full speed with just a lot of idle
time). I set the values in the delay loop to come reasonably close to the
speed of a normal PC. SLOW.COM will only work with programs that run under
dos and do not disable the timer interupt or the user vector for timer.

NOSLOW.COM
	revectors the user vector for timer back to the IRET in the bios so
that the AT runs at full speed again.




When I get an AT tech ref I will put together a SLOW.COM that works with just
about anything.
