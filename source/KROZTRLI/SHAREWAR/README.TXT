These games were developed in this order:

     1) CAVERNS  - 40 levels, the easiest of the three
     2) DUNGEONS - 30 levels, the most difficult
     3) KINGDOM  - 25 levels, has the most features (or objects)

Similar games can be found in Apogee Software Productions' new FUN-PAKS.

NOTE:  This version of KINGDOM OF KROZ is a newer, better version than the
       one you may already have.  The older version has a rare bug in it that
       could cause it to lock up your computer.  (It was rare, but it could
       happen.)

Response for the Kroz games have been outstanding.  That is, only positive
comments have come in.  KINGDOM OF KROZ even won a national programming
contest earlier this year.  It took top honors as the "Best Game".


                          The Shareware Concept:
These games are shareware.  Shareware is a way to market software by
independent authors or small software companies (such as ASP).  We rely on
the honesty of users to support the shareware concept, which is basically a
"try-before-you-buy" marketing method.


NOTE:  The SLOW.COM program provided on this disk can be used on those IBM
       compatible computers that run at higher speeds than 16 mhz.  To use
       SLOW.COM type SLOW before your run KROZ games.  Make certain that
       you are not running any other RAM resident programs (like SideKick, etc.)
       when you use SLOW.COM or it may not work correctly.

       These Kroz games are already set up internally to handle various
       computer speeds from 4.77 mhz to 16 mhz.  Simply answer the speed
       question that pops up at the beginning of the game.

Our best adventure game requires an entire 360K disk!  Has as many features as
even the best commercial adventure games, and then some.  Like a 16-color
screen, ASCII graphics (that even work on nongraphic systems), 1000+ word
dictionary, over 160 game locations, scores of sound effects, a "hint"
command, and more.

You begin on a remote mining planet with just your battered space ship and the
hope that one day you'll have a job that actually pays!  After an amazing
discover you begin a trek that spans four planets, including a huge planetship.
All to save a civilization from utter extinction--from a star ready to explode!

It's a text adventure game that mixes elements of science fiction, action,
fantasy and rollicking adventure.  The story begins with you standing aboard
the Titanic just seconds before the ship sinks!  In this story of riveting
survival you'll discover a long forgotten undersea mystery, travel to the
Earth's future, fly a shuttle to a floating city and be chased by a slobbering,
three-armed creature--and that's just the believable part!

"...as sophisticated as the best commercial adventure games by Infocom."

"As a programmer, I'm amazed that this game understands full english sentences.
We've been working--unsuccessfully--on this area for a year now.  Can we buy
your code?"                                       -- Dr. Paul Short, AZ

love this game, send me a list of other games you've made."

T.V. Guide magazine called Star Trek "...the most popular TV series of all
time."  Now we challenge your knowlegde of the award winning show with a
series of 10 Star Trek trivia games.  Each volume has 100 multiple choice
questions, and when you answer a question correctly you'll be rewarded with
a "Bonus Fact".  Bonus Facts are additional tidbits that even further expand
your Star Trek knowledge.

What type of crystal is used to power the engines of the Enterprise?  What
is Mr. Spock's first name?  How fast is warp 2?  What does the Prime
Directive prevent the crew of the Enterprise from doing?

Did you know that Dr. McCoy's medical instruments were actually modified
salt and pepper shakers.  Or that it was Leonard Nemoy who developed the
idea of Mr. Spock's Vulcan nerve pinch (so as to make Spock less violent).
Or that the Enterprise is 947 feet long.  Or that Joan Collins, Terri Garr,
and Ricardo Montalban all appeared in a Star Trek episode. Or...

It's all in Trek Trivia.  Order all 10 volumes and pay only $30--a $10
savings!

"I'm a Star Trek fan and these trivia games answer my prayers, thank you!"

A new idea.  We've taken the best programs submitted to us by outside game
authors and combined them into categories, 4 per disk.  None of these games
have ever been released anywhere else before.  They are not public domain, nor
are they shareware.  They're originals, and for the minimal price, they're a
bargain, too.  Currently, we have two FUN-PAKS:


                        ADVENTURE FUN-PAK
                        อออออออออออออออออ
                         * ROGUE RUNNER
                         * NIGHT BOMBER
                         * RAIDERS OF THE FORBIDDEN MINE
                         * THE THING


                         PUZZLE FUN-PAK
                         ออออออออออออออ
                         * PHRASE MASTER
                         * BLOCK FIVE
                         * MAZE MACHINE
                         * ASTEROID RESCUE



Apogee Software Productions is always looking for the best new software.  If
you think you have a program or game that qualifies send it in to our
Review Dept.  Send only completed projects please--bug free, too.

In the meantime have fun and good luck.
